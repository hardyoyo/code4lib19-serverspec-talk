# Wait, what? Getting your bearings with ServerSpec
## Lightning Talk, Code4Lib 2019, San Jose, CA

  Abstract: Library developers change jobs, we’re always the newbie.
  [ServerSpec](https://serverspec.org/) is a fantastic tool for keeping track of
  exactly what is supposed to be running on which server. Chances are such tests
  don’t exist in your current workplace; chances are such tests would be
  significantly helpful to your coworkers. This is a tool that should be in
  your box.

  NOTE: this talk was originally submitted as a workshop. The workshop was
  cancelled at the last minute due to space constraints. I re-worked the
  introduction to the workshop into a lightning talk instead. It just barely
  fits in five minutes, if I read my speakers notes very quickly. I apologize
  for my lack of eye contact.

  The two "live demo" portions are recorded and edited Asciinema screencasts.
  They did not display in the video recording of this talk, when I was using the
  Git-pitch embedded  screencast functionality. It is my hope that using
  Reveal.js directly will produce a slide deck which *will* be capable of
  being recorded.
